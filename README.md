# http-server: a command-line http server

`http-server` is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.  It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

# Installing globally:

Installation via `npm`.  If you don't have `npm` yet:

     curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
     
Once you have `npm`:

     npm install http-server -g
     
This will install `http-server` globally so that it may be run from the command line.

## Usage:

     http-server [path] [options]

`[path]` defaults to `./public` if the folder exists, and `./` otherwise.

# Installing as a node app

     mkdir myapp
     cd myapp/
     jitsu install http-server

*If you do not have `jitsu` installed you can install it via `npm install jitsu -g`*

## Usage

### Starting http-server locally

     node bin/http-server

*Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server*

### Deploy http-server to nodejitsu

     jitsu deploy

*You will now be prompted for a `subdomain` to deploy your application on*

## Available Options:

`-p` Port to listen for connections on (defaults to 8080)

`-a` Address to bind to (defaults to '0.0.0.0')

`-d` Show directory listings (defaults to 'True')

`-i` Display autoIndex (defaults to 'True')

`-e` or `--ext` Default file extension (defaults to 'html')

`-s` or `--silent` In silent mode, log messages aren't logged to the console.

`-h` or `--help` Displays a list of commands and exits.

`-c` Set cache time (in seconds) for cache-control max-age header, e.g. -c10 for 10 seconds. To disable caching, use -c-1.
